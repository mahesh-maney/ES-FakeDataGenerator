Elastic-search Upgrade
There are 3 VMS that form the Elastic-search cluster. The configuration is defined in the elasticsearch.yml file. This file is placed in location -- /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
This file contains the following 
		cluster.name : 'elasticsearch'
node.name	: 'localhost'
path.data	: <path-of-the-data-folder> Location where the indexed  
   data is to be stored.
path.logs	: <path-of-the-log-folder> Location where the log is to 
  be stored.
network.host	: 0.0.0.0
transport.tcp.port: 9300
http.port: 9200
indices.query.bool.max_clause_count: 10240 <Length of the query>
bootstrap.system_call_filter: false
script.engine.groovy.inline.search: on

The below settings has to be changed for elastic-search to start seamlessly
Open “/etc/security/limits.conf” and add the following;
* soft nofile 65536
* hard nofile 131072
* soft nproc 2048
* hard nproc 4096
	
Open “vim /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf” and add the following;
		#*          soft    nproc     1024
  *          soft    nproc     2048

	Open “vim /etc/sysctl.conf”
		# Added for Elasticsearch
   vm.max_map_count = 262144
	
execute the command -> “sysctl -p”
If we do not specify the cluster-name, elastic-search will assign a default name to the cluster as “elasticsearch”
The cluster-name in the elasticsearch.yml and the in the java client should be the same.
